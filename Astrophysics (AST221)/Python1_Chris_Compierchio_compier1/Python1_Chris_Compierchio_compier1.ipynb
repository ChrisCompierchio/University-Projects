    "## Before you begin\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming you have loaded this file into your Jupyter Notebooks workspace, make sure to press the \"play\" button at the top of the page in each box. This will render the Markdown into nicely-formatted text and execute all of the sections of Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook will serve as the template for your Python 1 assignment. You will be working through the content it contains and then filling in your own work in the spaces provided. There are detailed instructions on how to prepare your assignment available on Quercus under \"Python 1: The Sun's Declination\" in the week 2 module. Make sure you consult those instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those of you with some programming experience will find the early parts of this assignment very easy. That's okay. Please just speed through them and don't worry about it. But for those who are new to programming, the early portions should give you some experience in modifying pre-existing code and showing you the syntax for typical calculations and plots that you will be asked to produce later in the course. \n",
    "\n",
    "## PART 1: MODIFYING CODE\n",
    "\n",
    "The following sections of code will take you through a short progression from one of the very simplest pieces of code you can write to a few things that are a little bit more complex. In case you wind up searching the Internet for help, keep in mind that this code is written in Python 3. You will find a lot of documentation for previous versions of Python which may not be compatible.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you modify each of the following segments of code, remember to hit the \"play\" button at the top of the notebooks interface so that the cell containing the code \"runs\" (you can also hit Shift+Return for the same functionality). It should display the output of the piece of code just below that cell. You can run every cell in this notebook before you modify it, just to see what it produces. If you find any of this confusing or overwhelming, please refer back to the programming resources in the \"Guides\" section on Quercus. The \"Introduction to Programming\" guide contains links to some documents that should help you.\n",
